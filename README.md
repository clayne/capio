#capio

For most hackers, **strace** is the primary go-to tool when they need to
see what some program is doing under the hood, but inspecting **strace**
output can be a laborious and time consuming task.

**capio** is very similar to **strace** but it focus on inspecting the
I/O of the traced programs.

##Installation

Currently, **capio** works only on Linux for x86_64.

Clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/salva/capio.git and
run `make`.
